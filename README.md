## Global Fertility Rates

Interactive lists and map of fertility rates, built with Vue.js and Mapbox. [View working component](https://sean-kelliher-global-fertility-rates.netlify.app).

## Project Status

Next steps, I want to do more extensive accessibility and browser testing.

## Reflection

My goal was to build a component to show variances in fertility rates around the world. I choose to show the highest and lowest rate nations, all nations from high to low, and rates by world regions. I built a number of lists as well as an interactive Mapbox globe with shading to show the rate in each nation.
